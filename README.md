The Simon game is a classic memory game where players must repeat sequences of colors or sounds generated by the game. As the game progresses, the sequences become longer and more challenging. Here's an overview of how the Simon game works and how you can create it using JavaScript:

Game Concept:
1. Colors and Sounds: The game typically uses four colored buttons: red, green, blue, and yellow. Each button is associated with a unique sound.
2. Sequence Generation: The game generates a random sequence of these colors, starting with one and increasing by one with each round.
3. Player Input: The player must replicate the sequence by clicking the colored buttons in the correct order.
4. Progression: If the player correctly reproduces the sequence, they move to the next round, where the sequence becomes longer. If they make a mistake, the game ends.
